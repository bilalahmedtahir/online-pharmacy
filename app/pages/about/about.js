            Children’s Hospital Karachi will provide compassionate, accessible,
            high quality, and cost-effective healthcare to the local community,
            Karachi city, Pakistan, as well as the neighboring countries; the
            hospital will particularly cater pediatric medicine, surgery, and
            sub-specialties under one roof. At Children’s Hospital Karachi, we
            place as much emphasis on a child’s emotional needs as we do on
            caring for a child’s illness. Children are cared for in a facility
            especially designed for the unique care of children. Reflecting the
            best practices in paediatric medicine, our inpatient units are
            organized to treat children with common conditions or illnesses.
            Each of our condition-specific specialty care units is staffed by
            expert physicians and nurses solely dedicated to the healthcare
            needs of their patients.
